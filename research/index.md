## Research Interests

* Formation process of precious metal deposits, especially hydrothermal gold deposits
* Source of metals in metal deposits
* Large-scale factors that control the formation of giant precious metal deposits (e.g., tectonic settings and environmental change)
* Effective exploration of precious metal deposits

## Academic Background

#### 2019 January
* Visiting Student, Department of Geology, Universidad de Chile

#### 2018-present
* **Masterâ€™s Student**, Department of Systems Innovation, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan
  * Thesis: *A New Formation Model of Nansatsu-Type Gold Deposits Constrained from Geochemical Analysis* (in progress)


#### 2014-2018
* **Bachelor of Engineering, Energy and Environment Systems**, Department of Systems Innovation, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan
  * Thesis: *Geochemical Behavior of Gold in Nansatsu-Type Gold Deposits Constrained from Bulk Chemical Analysis*
